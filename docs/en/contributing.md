## Quick Checklist

Before submitting a patch, ensure:

1. Code compiles cleanly for at least one platform
2. Code passes `scripts/check-patch.sh`
3. Every commit has a `Signed-off-by` tag
4. Commit message follows the format described below

## Commit Message Format

```
subsystem: short summary of change

Optional longer description explaining the motivation
and approach. Wrap at 76 characters.

Signed-off-by: Your Name <your@email.com>
```

### Rules

- **Subject line**: `subsystem: description` (lowercase subsystem, no trailing dot)
- **Subject length**: 76 characters max
- **Body**: separated from subject by a blank line, wrapped at 76 characters
- **Signed-off-by**: required on every commit (`git commit -s`)

### Subsystem Prefixes

| Prefix     | Scope                                     |
|------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `osal`     | OS abstraction layer (`osal/`)            |
| `gateway`  | Message routing (`claw/core/gateway.*`)   |
| `swarm`    | Swarm service (`claw/services/swarm/`)    |
| `net`      | Network service (`claw/services/net/`)    |
| `ai`       | AI engine (`claw/services/ai/`)           |
| `platform` | Platform-specific changes (`platform/`)   |
| `build`    | Build system (SCons, CMake, scripts)      |
| `docs`     | Documentation changes                     |
| `tools`    | Tool scripts (`tools/`, `scripts/`)       |

### Examples

```
gateway: add priority-based message routing

Messages now carry a priority field. The gateway dispatches
high-priority messages before low-priority ones in each
routing cycle.

### Additional Tags

- `Fixes: <sha> ("original commit subject")` — when fixing a previous commit
- `Tested-by:` / `Reviewed-by:` — attribution for testing and review

## Coding Style

See [Coding Style](coding-style.md) for the full coding style guide.

Key points:
- 4 spaces, no tabs
- 80-char line width target
- `claw_` prefix for public API
- Traditional C comments (`/* */`)
- C99 (gnu99)

## Code Check Tools

### Style Checker

```bash
# Check all source in scope (claw/ + osal/ + include/)
scripts/check-patch.sh

# Check staged changes (useful before committing)
scripts/check-patch.sh --staged

# Check specific files
scripts/check-patch.sh --file claw/core/gateway.c
```

### Sign-off Checker

```bash
# Check commits since main
scripts/check-dco.sh

# Check last 3 commits
scripts/check-dco.sh --last 3
```

### Git Hooks

Install git hooks to automatically check style and commit messages:

```bash
scripts/install-hooks.sh          # install
scripts/install-hooks.sh --remove # remove
```

Hooks installed:
- **pre-commit**: runs `check-patch.sh --staged` on code in `claw/`, `osal/`, and `include/`
- **commit-msg**: validates commit message format and Signed-off-by

## Patch Guidelines

### Split Patches

Each commit should be a self-contained, compilable change. Don't combine
unrelated changes in one commit.

### Don't Include Irrelevant Changes

Don't mix style fixes with functional changes. If code needs reformatting,
submit it as a separate commit.

### Test Your Changes

- Build for at least one platform before submitting
- If adding a feature, include a basic test or demo if applicable
