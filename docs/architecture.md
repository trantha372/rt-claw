# rt-claw Architecture

## Overview

rt-claw brings the OpenClaw personal assistant concept to embedded RTOS devices.
Each rt-claw node is a lightweight, real-time capable unit that can operate
standalone or join a swarm of nodes for distributed intelligence.

Multi-RTOS support through OSAL (OS Abstraction Layer) — same core code runs
on FreeRTOS (ESP-IDF) and RT-Thread with zero modification.

## OSAL — OS Abstraction Layer

The key architectural decision: all rt-claw core code depends only on `claw_os.h`.

```
src/*.c  --->  #include "claw_os.h"  (compile-time interface)
                        |
          +-------------+-------------+
          |                           |
  claw_os_freertos.c          claw_os_rtthread.c
  (linked on ESP-IDF)         (linked on RT-Thread)
```

Abstracted primitives:
- Thread, Mutex, Semaphore, Message Queue, Timer
- Memory allocation (malloc/free)
- Logging (CLAW_LOGI/LOGW/LOGE/LOGD)
- Tick / time

Design: interface header + per-RTOS implementation file (link-time binding).
Zero runtime overhead. No function pointers. No conditional compilation in core code.

## Core Services

### Gateway (src/core/gateway)

Central message router inspired by OpenClaw's Gateway architecture.

- Thread-safe message queue (via `claw_mq_*`)
- Channel-based routing (source -> destination)
- Message types: DATA, CMD, EVENT, SWARM

### Swarm Service (src/services/swarm)

Node discovery and coordination for building a mesh of rt-claw devices.

- UDP broadcast discovery on local network
- ESP-NOW for ultra-low-latency P2P (ESP32 platforms)
- Heartbeat-based liveness detection
- Capability advertisement
- Task distribution across the swarm

### Network Service (src/services/net)

Platform-aware networking:

- ESP32-C3: WiFi (802.11 b/g/n) + MQTT + mbedTLS
- QEMU-A9: Ethernet (smc911x) + lwIP + MQTT
- Common: MQTT topic-based channel system (maps to OpenClaw's multi-channel)

### AI Engine (src/services/ai)

Lightweight inference runtime:

- Rule engine for local decision making
- MQTT relay to cloud LLM APIs
- TinyML model execution (future)

## Platforms

### ESP32-C3 (platform/esp32c3/)

- CPU: RISC-V 32-bit (rv32imc), 160MHz
- RAM: 400KB SRAM (~240KB available for app)
- WiFi: 802.11 b/g/n
- BLE: Bluetooth 5.0 LE
- RTOS: ESP-IDF + FreeRTOS
- Build: CMake (idf.py)
- QEMU: Espressif fork (qemu-riscv32), UART only (no WiFi sim)

### QEMU vexpress-a9 (platform/qemu-a9-rtthread/)

- CPU: ARM Cortex-A9 (dual-core)
- RTOS: RT-Thread
- Build: SCons
- Peripherals: UART, Ethernet, LCD, SD card

## ESP32-C3 Resource Budget

| Module | SRAM | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| ESP-IDF + WiFi + TLS | ~160KB | System overhead |
| Gateway | ~8KB | MQ 16x256B + thread |
| Swarm | ~12KB | 32 nodes + ESP-NOW |
| Net (MQTT) | ~25KB | Client + buffers |
| AI Engine | ~15KB | Rule engine |
| App + CLI | ~10KB | Main + shell |
| **Total** | **~230KB** | ~170KB headroom |
